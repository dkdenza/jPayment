Installation instructions
-------------------------

Installation is quite easy: copy the contents of the src folder to any location
in your application required.

Example:

If your web root folder is /var/www/ you may want to create a subfolder called
/var/www/src/ and copy the files into that folder.


Getting started
---------------

A good way to get started is to run some of the tests included in the download.
Copy the "examples" and "logs" folder to the same level "src" folder from above.
Change "logs" to writeable mode (CHMOD 0777)
...

Start running the test by pointing your browser to the test scripts:

http://example.com/examples/index.php
